# Crypto Trader Behavior vs. Market Sentiment Analysis

### Overview

This project analyzes cryptocurrency trader data from Hyperliquid by merging it with a daily "Fear & Greed Index" to understand how market sentiment impacts trading behavior.

The core of the project is a Python script (hyperliquid_analysis.py) designed to be run in a Google Colab notebook. It performs the following steps:

1. **Downloads Data**: Fetches the trader transaction dataset and the historical sentiment data from Google Drive.

2. **Cleans & Preprocesses**: Renames columns, converts timestamps, and handles missing data.

3. **Aggregates Data**: Groups individual trades into daily summaries (total PnL, total volume, long/short ratio, etc.).

4. **Merges Data**: Combines the daily aggregated trader data with the daily sentiment data.

5. **Generates Visualizations**: Creates and saves several box plots to visualize the relationship between sentiment and key trading metrics (P&L, volume, long/short ratio).

6. **Saves Processed Data**: Outputs the final merged-and-aggregated dataset to a new CSV file.

### Files Generated by the Script

When you run the Python script, it will create the following files:

`/needed/csv_files/daily_behavior_sentiment_analysis.csv`: The final, processed data table used for the analysis.

`/needed/outputs/sentiment_distribution.png`: A bar chart showing the number of days for each sentiment category in the dataset.

`/needed/outputs/pnl_vs_sentiment.png`: A box plot showing the distribution of daily Total PnL for each sentiment category.

`/needed/outputs/volume_vs_sentiment.png`: A box plot showing the distribution of daily trading volume for each sentiment category.

`/needed/outputs/long_short_vs_sentiment.png`: A box plot showing the distribution of the daily long/short volume ratio for each sentiment category.
